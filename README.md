### 2.
There are two ways of using the Game Title field. You can start typing the name of the Game and this will present you with a list to choose from. Simply click the correct one and move to the next step. If you are having trouble finding the movie you want I recommend using the Rawg Link method below.

The other method is using the Rawg Link. First visit https://rawg.io and search for the Game Title. For example Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 https://rawg.io/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2. So copy & paste this link into the Game Title field.

### 3.
Next, you'll want to grab the offical trailer of the Game from youtube. Usually Googling the Game name and year will give you the trailer. Paste the Youtube Link into the "Youtube Trailer" Field.

### 4. (Optional)
Enter the Crack / Repack info of the Game Release.
This Information you might get from the Source of the Game.

### 5.
Enter your VirusTotal Links for every executable File.
Informations about the VirusTotal Scan Regulations you can find [HERE](https://blackpearl.biz/threads/5726/)

To enter multiple VirusTotal links, ensure there is a space between each of the links.

For example:
            `virustotallink1 virustotallink2 virustotallink3`

### 6.
Enter your download link. Be sure it's one of the accepted file hosts. You can see all the allowed filehosts [HERE](https://blackpearl.biz/faq/#q-which-file-hosters-are-accepted-on-the-forum)

To enter multiple download links, ensure there is a space between each of the links.

For example:
            `downloadlink1 downloadlink2 downloadlink3`

### 7.
The Downcloud button is clickable(Either on or off). The only reason you would need to turn it off is if you are posting multiple links or using a [Base64 Encoded String](https://www.base64encode.org/). HideReactScore has a maximum limit of 100 and minimum of 0 (0 will not add it).
HidePosts has a maximum limit of 50 and minimum of 0(0 will not add it) You can find more about what each of these do [HERE](https://blackpearl.biz/help/bb-codes/).

### 8.
Once you have set everything up, be sure that you are in BBCode Mode ![](https://i.imgur.com/oX1AzQ4.png) and press the "Generate Template" button and the post will be copied to your clipboard and pasted onto the site. The Title will be filled out with the Name of Game and the Year of release. You will have to add all the other required information yourself.
If you have not selected anything for the Game field (Either clicked on a name or entered a proper Rawg.io Link) You will be prompted with an alert box telling you so.
